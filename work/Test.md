description: In this project I was given the verbal description of an object and used this description as inspiration to create a non-objective sculpture.
process_des: I assembled the Frame by soldering copper tubes and joints together. I let the act of making dominate as I sculpted the body with clay. I then fired it with clear glaze and dripped candle wax on the exterior.
