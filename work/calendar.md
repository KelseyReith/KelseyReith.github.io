description: This a calendar that breaks the conventions of the wall hanging, grid
  structured calendar. It's inspired by the game of Dungeons and Dragons, hence why
  the calendar takes the form of a twelve sided die which each face representing a
  month of the year while depicting a class one can play in the game. Rather than
  setting the numbered days of the month on a grid, the numbers reflect the imagery
  of each class.
